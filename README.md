# INN-Hotels
To mitigate the financial impact of cancellations, INN Hotels seeks a Machine Learning-based predictive solution. The goal is to Identify key factors influencing booking cancellations. Predict cancellations in advance to allow proactive decision-making. Develop data-driven policies for pricing, cancellation fees, and overbooking strategies. 

Model Performance Overview
1.Training Performance:
	Standard and pre-pruned Decision Trees exhibit high accuracy (~99%) but may be overfitting.
	Post-pruned Decision Tree shows reduced accuracy (~90%) but better generalization.

2.  Test Set Performance:
All models perform equally with 87% accuracy.
Recall (~81%) suggests the model effectively identifies most cancellations.
Precision (~79%) implies some false positives, but overall reliability is reasonable.
